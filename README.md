# mise-maven

An [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) plugin for
[mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise), a universal tooling version manager.

## Getting started

After installing [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise),
you can install this plugin by running the following command:

```bash
mise plugin install maven
```

You can then install a default version of maven like this:

```bash
mise use -g maven@3
```

The above command will instruct mise-maven to always use the latest version of
Maven 3 by default.

## Using specific Maven versions

You can install a specific version of Maven like this:

```bash
mise install maven@3.5.4
```

and switch versions like this:

```bash
mise use maven@3.5.4
```

This will create a new entry in the .mise.toml file at your repository's root.

## Support for other Maven version manager configuration files

If you work in a team that uses SDKMan or mvnvm to manage a project's supported
maven version, mise-maven also supports reading these files. If you already have
the version of maven installed, `mvn` should automatically be configured to use
the version specified in the legacy configuration file. If you see an error
regarding the version of maven not being installed, simply run:

```bash
mise install maven
```

## Contributing

Before contributing ensure all dependencies (and your contribution) is licensed
with an [open-source license compatible with the Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a).
Add information about your intellectual property rights to the [NOTICE](NOTICE)
file, as well as any dependencies or third-party code used to create your
contribution. The [LICENSE](LICENSE) file should not be modified.

### Getting started

**mise-maven** is currently integrated against the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS

To contribute to the plugin's development, first you will need to make a
GitHub fork of the **mise-maven** repository, and then clone into it using
the following command (replace `<your-github-username>` with the name of the
account used to create the fork:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<your-github-username>/mise-maven.git
```

To test the plugin, you will need to run the following command from within the
project's root directory:

```bash
./tests/run-all.sh
```

Assuming you have correctly configured your environment, this will result in
the unit test suite running and displaying a successful result.

#### Using your development checkout with mise

To use the development checkout with mise, run the following commands:

```bash
# If you are already using mise-maven or another maven plugin for mise you
# will need to run:
mise plugin uninstall maven

cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
mise plugin link maven $PWD
```

### Adding dependencies

Any runtime dependencies required by mise-maven to operate correctly when
used by an end-user should be directly bundled into the source code.
Dependencies used for development or testing purposes only may be added
as git submodules or configured through mise.
